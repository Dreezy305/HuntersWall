    title: `What do we mean by digitalized alternative assets?
`,
    content: `
Our assets fall under alternative category, which include tangible assets like real estate; commodities such as agricultural produce, gold, silver, copper etc.; financial tools such as venture capital, loan, and many more. Their functions depend on the characteristics of each
kind of asset. For example, real estate investment can be residential for private use to grow
equity or for rental income; venture capital funding for equity stake; gold/silver acquisition as
hedge against inflation.
We digitalize these assets, by allowing Investors to buy fractions of these alternative investments on this platform, not only to have effective hedge against inflation, but also
generate annual income, as well as possible increased asset value.  Although, this is not risk free, but the reward is greater.`,
